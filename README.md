# fcc-english-course
This repository is created to document my progress and completion of the FreeCodeCamp (FCC) English Course. Since the course is still in beta and no official certificate is available yet, I have included a screenshot of my progress as evidence of course completion.

## Screenshot of Progress
The screenshot of my progress can be found in the folder of this repository.

## Purpose
This repository serves as a personal record of achievement and showcases my dedication to improving my English skills through FreeCodeCamp's curriculum.
